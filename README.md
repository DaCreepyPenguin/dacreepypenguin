# Hi there traveler!

I'm Arthur, also known as DaCreepyPenguin. Im a first year diploma student studing computer science in the UK.

### Me
I mostly write in Python and Javascript however I am confident in c# and I am learning Java and C++
<br>
I started programming as a hobby around 6 or 7 years ago with small bits of javascript (along side html and css) and python in the early ages of Secondary School however I only started programming with the thought of a career in the last 4 or 5 years, heavily inspired by my brother.
<br>
Most of my time goes into developing games, most of which never see the light of day but some can be found on my itch.io <b>(https://dcpenguin.itch.io/)</b> page. For this, I use mostly the GODOT engine with GDScript but sometimes I use Unity and I have past experience with Unreal4. I find its very dependent on the type of game I am making.
<br>
I use VScode for most of my programming, IDEA for java and VisualStudio for c# (as much as I am not a fan of it)
<br>
Since my unintentional (thanks windows) move to linux I have not used c# for a few months although I have occasionally made console apps to keep the skill alive in my brain.
<br>
I am confident with Windows and GNU Linux distros (I mostly use Ubuntu for my programming and kali when I want to feel cool for no reason but I can use and debian based distro)


### What am I doing?
<ul>
  <li>Working on some games</li>
  <li>Developing a website portfolio which will be posted here as soon as its ready</li>
  <li>Learning advanced OOP concepts</li>
  <li>Self teaching myself electronics in an attempt to gain a better understanding of the internals of computers</li>
</ul>

### My future
I am looking for a career in computer science after I have completed my studies in the next few years however I am also looking for work during that period.

### How to reach me

Currently I have no easy way to be reached other than issues on this repo although I will soon have a portfolio page that will serve as a hub for all my work
<br><br>
So thats about it, thank you for reading this through and I hope to see you around :)
